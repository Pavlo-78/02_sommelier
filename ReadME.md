## About procject
The project was developed to showcase proficiency in crafting intricate SQL queries.
The project's premise revolves around a client seeking a specific type of wine not available in-store. Our task is to identify alternative options closely matching the desired wine in terms of price, taste profile, aftertaste, and customer ratings.

## How to see the result?

NOTE: 
The service may enter sleep mode if not used for 15 minutes. 
When accessing the link for the first time, it may take about a minute to display the web page as the server wakes up. Subsequent clicks will be faster.
